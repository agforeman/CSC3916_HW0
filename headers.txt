  GET /books/v1/volumes?format=json&q=turing HTTP/1.1
    GET is the method we are using, meaning we are asking the server to
    provide us with information. In this case we asking the server for the
    information at the URI /books/v1/volumes with the parameters format=json
    and q(title)=turing. HTTP/1.1 means that we are using the HTTP/1.1
    protocol.

  Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*
    Accept is the media type that the client is willing to accept as
    a response. In this case, the client is willing to accept a json object
    or plain text. It appears that the client is also willing to accept any
    media type based on the */*, which appears to be a wildcard; however,
    I do not know if this is accurate or not.

  User-Agent: axios/0.18.0
    User-Agent is the user-agent string of the client. This allows the
    server to determine from what program (browser, etc) the client is
    making the request. This allows the server to ensure it can respond
    in a compatible way. In this case, we used version 0.18.0 of the
    axios client to communicate with the server.

  Host: www.googleapis.com
    This is the domain name to which the request will be routed. The port
    should also be included after the domain name, however communicating
    over the default port it can be omitted.

  Connection: close
    Connection close tells the server that the connection should be closed
    after the response is sent.

# Response Header:                                                          #
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  expires: Mon, 04 Feb 2019 03:08:31 GMT
    This gives the date/time that determines when the response is stale. In
    this case the response is fresh until 8:08 PM MST which was when the
    response was set.

  date: Mon, 04 Feb 2019 03:08:31 GMT
    This gives the date/time which the response was sent. As above the
    response was sent at 8:08 PM MST.

  cache-control: private, max-age=0, must-revalidate, no-transform
    This defines how the response should be cached, in the network. Private
    means that no nodes along the network should cache the response only the
    machine that sent the request. A max-age of 0 means that the response
    should not be cached. The third parameter, must-revalidate, specifies
    that any node that has a stale copy of the response must revalidate
    at the origin server before serving the content. Finally, no-transform,
    tells all nodes on the network that they are not allowed to modify
    or transform the content in any way.

  etag: "IUREzboS_XZycecz4xfru1ipYfo/Y53a_FieGsULoEZgwEmYh9G3w18"
    An ETag is an identifier for a specific version of a resource. In this
    case, the identifier is
    IUREzboS_XZycecz4xfru1ipYfo/Y53a_FieGsULoEZgwEmYh9G3w18.

  vary: Origin, X-Origin
    The vary key specifies how downstream proxies should match future
    request headers to decide whether the cached response can be used or if
    a new one must be requested. In this case, I believe that the response
    specifies that a new one must be requested.

  content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
    This is the media type of the response body. The response is a JSON
    formatted string, using UTF-8 character encoding.

  x-content-type-options: nosniff
    This prevents Internet Explorer from altering a response's content-type
    away from its declared type. This also applies to Google Chrome when
    downloading extensions

  x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN
    X-Frame-Options specify if the browser is allowed to render the
    information inside of a frame, iframe, embed, or object. The value,
    SAMEORIGIN, means that the information can only be displayed in a frame
    on the same origin as the page itself. This prevents the content from
    being embedded in another site.

  x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block
    X-XSS-Protection is a feature that stops pages from loading when they
    detect reflected cross-site scripting attacks. A value of 1 enables
    this filter and mode=block specifies that if an attack is detected the
    page is not rendered.

  content-length: 37784
    The length of the response body, in octets, is the Content-Length. This
    response's is 37784 octets.

  server: GSE
    GSE is the server from which the response was sent.

  alt-svc: quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="44,43,39"
    This section tells the client alternate services from which the
    requested information can be obtained. QUIC is the acronym for
    Quick UDP Internet Connections, which is a new experimental transport
    layer network protocol. The ":443" specifies that the information the
    client can communicate using this protocol over port 443. MA, short
    for max-age, specifies the time in seconds for which the service is
    considered valid for establishing new connections. As far as I can
    tell from some internet research, the v refers to which versions
    of QUIC are supported.

  connection: close
    Like in the request header connection: close tells the client to close
    the connection after receiving the response.
